Module 2 Challenge - VBA
For this assignment, I will practice analyzing stock market data across multiple worksheets by calculating key metrics for each stock and identifying the greatest changes.

Instructions
Create a VBA script that processes stock market data by identifying each unique stock ticker across four different worksheets representing the quarters of the year 2022.

Calculate and output the following for each stock:

Quarterly Change: The dollar change in stock price from the opening price on the first trading day of the quarter to the closing price on the last trading day of the quarter.
Percentage Change: The percentage change in stock price over the quarter.
Total Volume: The total trading volume for the stock over the quarter.
Apply conditional formatting to highlight positive percentage changes in green and negative percentage changes in red.

Identify and print the stock with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume for each quarter.

Ensure that the script runs across all four worksheets ("Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4") simultaneously.
